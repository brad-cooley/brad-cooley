# Hi 👋, I'm Brad Cooley

### A passionate software engineer and data scientist from Colorado

- 💼 I’m currently working as a Teaching Assistant at Marquette University for COSC 3250: Operating Systems. I am an incoming data science intern at [Steelcase](https://www.steelcase.com/).

- 🔭 In my freetime I am working on [Abacus](https://github.com/acm-mu/abacus).

- 🌱 I’m currently learning [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and various AWS skills.

- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on **AI related projects.** Stuff like [this paper on Predictive Inequity in Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.11097.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0XylkVZ-dRJZ_II6Me5200IWjvFYylQ1zInyZrlpwXFP6Ns7S7JZ7jeOc) is super fascinating to me.
